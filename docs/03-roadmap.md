- Improved documentation and tutorials.
- Improved error messages.
- Graphical interface to view and configure logs.
- Graphical interface for viewing server health and metrics.
- File uploads for Google cloud (AWS currently supported).
- More options for authentication (Apple, Google, and email is currently supported).
- Easier deployments.
