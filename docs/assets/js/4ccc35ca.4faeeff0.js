This creates a relationship between different rows within the same table.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/database/sort":{"id":"concepts/database/sort","title":"Sort","description":"It is often desirable to order the results of a database query. The \'find\' method has an orderBy parameter where you can specify a column for sorting. The parameter takes a callback as an argument that passes a model-specific table descriptor, also accessible through the t field on the model. The table descriptor represents the database table associated with the model and includes fields for each corresponding column. The callback is then used to specify the column to sort by.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/database/transactions":{"id":"concepts/database/transactions","title":"Transactions","description":"The essential point of a database transaction is that it bundles multiple steps into a single, all-or-nothing operation. The intermediate states between the steps are not visible to other concurrent transactions, and if some failure occurs that prevents the transaction from completing, then none of the steps affect the database at all.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/exceptions":{"id":"concepts/exceptions","title":"Error handling and exceptions","description":"Handling errors well is essential when you are building your server.

You should set up your server to use Google Cloud Storage or S3 in production scenarios.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/health-checks":{"id":"concepts/health-checks","title":"Health checks","description":"Serverpod automatically performs health checks while running. It measures CPU and memory usage and the response time to the database. The metrics are stored in the database every minute in the serverpodhealthmetric and serverpodhealthconnection_info tables. However, the best way to visualize the data is through Serverpod Insights, which gives you a graphical view.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/logging":{"id":"concepts/logging","title":"Logging","description":"Serverpod uses the database for storing logs; this makes it easy to search for errors, slow queries, or debug messages. To log custom messages during the execution of a session, use the log method of the session object. When the session is closed, either from successful execution or by failing from throwing an exception, the messages are written to the log. By default, session log entries are written for every completed session.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/models":{"id":"concepts/models","title":"Working with models","description":"Models are Yaml files used to define serializable classes in Serverpod. They are used to generate Dart code for the server and client, and, if a database table is defined, to generate database code for the server.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/modules":{"id":"concepts/modules","title":"Modules","description":"Serverpod is built around the concept of modules. A Serverpod module is similar to a Dart package but contains both server, client, and Flutter code. A module contains its own namespace for endpoints and methods to minimize the risk of conflicts.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/scheduling":{"id":"concepts/scheduling","title":"Scheduling","description":"With Serverpod you can schedule future work with the future call feature. Future calls are calls that will be invoked at a later time. An example is if you want to send a drip-email campaign after a user signs up. You can schedule a future call for a day, a week, or a month. The calls are stored in the database, so they will persist even if the server is restarted.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/serialization":{"id":"concepts/serialization","title":"Custom serialization","description":"For most purposes, you will want to use Serverpod\'s native serialization. However, there may be cases where you want to serialize more advanced objects. With Serverpod, you can pass any serializable objects as long as they conform to three simple rules:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/server-events":{"id":"concepts/server-events","title":"Server events","description":"Serverpod framework comes with a built-in event messaging system. This enables efficient message exchange within and across servers, making it ideal for scenarios where shared state is needed, such as coordinating streams or managing data across a server cluster.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/sessions":{"id":"concepts/sessions","title":"Sessions","description":"The Session object provides information about the current context in a method call in Serverpod. It provides access to the database, caching, authentication, data storage, and messaging within the server. It will also contain information about the HTTP request object.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/streams":{"id":"concepts/streams","title":"Streams","description":"For some applications, it\'s not enough to be able to call server-side methods. You may also want to push data from the server to the client or send data two-way. Examples include real-time games or chat applications. Luckily, Serverpod supports a framework for streaming data.

The web server allows you to access your database and business layer the same way you would from a method call from an app. This makes it very easy to share data for applications that need both an app and traditional web pages. You can also use the web server to create webhooks or generate custom REST APIs to communicate with 3rd party services.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/working-with-endpoints":{"id":"concepts/working-with-endpoints","title":"Working with endpoints","description":"Endpoints are the connection points to the server from the client. With Serverpod, you add methods to your endpoint, and your client code will be generated to make the method call. For the code to be generated, you need to place the endpoint file anywhere under the lib directory of your server. Your endpoint should extend the Endpoint class. For methods to be generated, they need to return a typed Future, and its first argument should be a Session object. The Session object holds information about the call being made and provides access to the database.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"contribute":{"id":"contribute","title":"Roadmap & contributions","description":"Serverpod is built by the community, for the community.
